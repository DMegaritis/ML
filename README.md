# ML.Table

This repository contains machine and deep learning implementations for classification and regression tasks. It includes four classes, each dedicated to a specific model type - neural networks (2x), linear regression, and logistic regression. For these models to work, you'll need a CSV file with both predictors and outcomes in wide format. The output is a table which is saved as a CSV file. 

In addition, there are examples provided on how to use these classes. Please note that this is the initial implementation, and the file paths are currently set as absolute paths.

This work has been used in the author's Doctoral thesis.
